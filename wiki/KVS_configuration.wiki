= Configuration =
It is necessary to set an environment variable 'KVS_DIR' before compiling KVS. The compiled libraries and header files are installed into the directory specified by it. And some KVS command line applications are installed into 'KVS_DIR/bin'. Therefore, the user have to add its directory to environment variable 'PATH'. Some examples of the configurations are shown here.

== Windows ==
In Windows,  the environment variables can be set by using the System Properties dialog. Open 'Control Panel' -> 'Performance and Maintenance' -> 'System', or right-click on My Computer and choose the 'Properties'. And then, click the 'Advanced' tab in the dialog and the following variables can be set by clicking the 'Environment Variables' button.

|| *Variable* || *Value* ||
|| KVS_DIR || C:\Program Files\kvs ||
|| PATH || %PATH%;%KVS_DIR%\bin ||

== Linux and Mac OS X ==
In Linux and Mac OS X,  the environment variables can be set as follows. For bash, the following descriptions should be added to .bashrc.

{{{
export KVS_DIR=/usr/local/kvs
export PATH=$KVS_DIR/bin:$PATH
}}}
